This is a simple solo program to keep and retrive texts using a search tool.
This is free to use so please go ahead. Just leave a quick note of your thoughts and improvement suggestions.

IMPORTANT NOTE: In order to work you will need to add a file at the src folder name users.json and initialize it wih square brackets.
The admin function has to be changed manually. The ideia is that you add the admin before any prod deploy, which should be personalized for each user.


Testing notes: 
This is not yet tested in both windows or Linux.
While building the win, I have set the standard compilaton to x64, so just 64 compatible. If you want to change it go to the package and configure it as your needs.
